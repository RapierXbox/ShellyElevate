## Hacking your Wall Display
There are two different methods to jailbreak your wall display, and you'll need to choose one:
* **UART**: This method is highly reliable, with nearly a 100% success rate. However, it requires soldering cables to your device and purchasing an inexpensive [USB2UART](https://aliexpress.com/item/32694152202.html) adapter.
* **MTKClient**: Although this method didn't work for me, it has been successful for others in the community. But it **can** work for you. It also doesnt require soldering.**TODO**

### Using UART
#### Install the required Software
* To interact with the UART2USB adapter, download a software like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org).

* Obtain the [Anroid plattform tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) for necessary interactions with your device.

* From the release tab, download the latest versions of the ShellyElevate APK, and the ultra-small launcher APK.

#### Disassembly and Soldering
##### 1. Remove Backplate:
* Remove the four screws holding the backplate in place and store them safely.<br>

* Lift the backplate cautiously and disconnect the FPC cable from the motherboard.<br>

(**NOTE:** I accidentally switched up 3v3 and rx in this picture but you should get the idea.)
#### Connect to your Display
##### 1. Connect to UART Adapter:
* Connect to your UART adapter at 921600bps.
##### 2. Get root access:
* In the shell, type `su` to get root access.
##### 3. Enable ADB:
* Execute the following commands to enable ADB permanently: <br>
`settings put global development_settings_enabled 1` <br>
`settings put global adb_enabled 1`<br>
`setprop persist.adb.tcp.port 5555`<br>
`setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555`<br>
`stop adbd`<br>
`start adbd`<br>
##### 4. Get IP Address:
* Obtain your IP address by typing `ifconfig`.
##### 5. Connect via ADB:
* On your computer, navigate to the platform tools directory and connect using: `./adb connect <your ip>:5555`
##### 6. Disable Shelly App:
* Disable the Shelly app with: `./adb root` <br>
`./adb shell pm disable cloud.shelly.stargate`<br>
##### 7. Install Launchers and Apps:
* Install the ultra-small launcher: `./adb install ultra-small-launcher.apk`
* Install the ShellyElevate app: <br>
`./adb install -g ShellyElevateV2.apk`
##### 8. Reboot and Launch
* Reboot the device with: `./adb shell reboot`
* After rebooting you are going to be met with a white screen!
##### 9. Setting up the Shelly Elevate app
* Click the bottom right of the display 10 times <br>
* After that click the bottom left of the display 10 times <br>
* You now will be in the settings. If you lost track of the times you pressed the right button just press the left button once to reset the count. <br>
* Now press on the Button to automaticly get the Home Assistant IP <br>
* If that doesnt work for you enter it in the text field below <br>
##### 10. Troublshooting:
* To return to the home screen, use: `./adb shell input keyevent 3`
## Configuration in Home Assistant
* In your configuration.yaml file add this:
```
switch:
  - platform: rest
    name: Relay Shelly Walldisplay
    resource: http://<your ip>:8080/relay
    body_on: "true"
    body_off: "false"
    is_on_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
    scan_interval: 10

sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: Temperature Shelly Walldisplay
    resource: http://<your ip>:8080/getTemp
    value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
    scan_interval: 120

  - platform: rest
    name: Humidity Shelly Walldisplay
    resource: http://<your ip>:8080/getHumidity
    value_template: "{{ value_json.humidity }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    scan_interval: 120
```
### Using the Wall Display as a Thermostat
To use the Wall Display as a thermostat, add the following code to your configuration.yaml file. You can also replace the target heater with another entity if needed.
```
climate:
  - platform: generic_thermostat
    name: Thermostat Shelly Wall Display
    heater: switch.relay_shelly_walldisplay
    target_sensor: sensor.temperature_shelly_walldisplay
```
